== Command line
.Output of `parsergen -h`
[source,bash]
----
USAGE: ./parsergen <Grammar> <Filename> <TokensOutput> [-I ARG] [-h]
DESCRIPTION:
  LR(1)/GLR-Parser Generator command line tool v1.6.1

  Where:
  1. <Grammar> is a grammar definition file.
  2. Generated C++ source files are named as:
     <Filename>IdDef.h - Lexical token enumerations
     <Filename>.h      - Header of parser class
     <Filename>.cpp    - Implementation of parser class
  3. Generated token definitions are written to <TokensOutput> to feed scannergen 

VALID FLAGS:
  -I, --include_dir ARG
	Search path of #include directive within <Grammar>
  -h, --help
	Display this help and exit
----

== Grammar
Grammar definition file consists of lines. There are 7 types of lines which can be mixed up *almost* in no particular order. No line type is mandatory. Those rare cases where line order does matter will be highlighted by ðŸ’£

// Grammar with Semantic Rules

All mean nothing else but enhancing readability. Put as many as you like where you like.

=== 2. Production rule
.Syntax
> _<NonTerminal>_ ::= (_<NonTerminal>_|_<Terminal>_)* +
  _<NonTerminal>_ ::= (_<NonTerminal>_|_<Terminal>_)* [[ +
ã€€   Multi-lined reduction code in C++ +
]]

.Example
[source,c++]
----
<All> ::= <Line>                        // <1>
<All> ::= <All> "\n" <Line>
<Line> ::= <Production> <Semantics> [[  // <2>
    auto &c = $c;
    if (!c.testCond())
        return;

    auto &prod = dynamic_cast<C_Production&>(*$1);
    if (!c.addProduction(prod, bux::tryUnlex<C_Semantic>($2))) [[unlikely]] // <3>
        $p.onError($1, "Production re-defined:\n"
                             "\t" + prod.str());
]]
----
<1> No annotation, no reduction.
<2> [[reduction_mnemonics]]Doubly-bracketed [[reduction code]] may contain the following mnemonics:
    - `$p` - Reference to the base parser class, _e.g._ of type `bux::LR1::C_Parser &`
    - `$P` - Reference to the generated parser class
    - `$c` - Reference to the context instance of the generated parser class if context type is defined by option `%CONTEXT`
    - `$r` - The result token buffer which can be freely assigned
    - `$1` `$2` `$3` ... denote the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, .. operand respectively to the right of ::= , terminal or non-terminal.
<3> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes[C++ Attributes] can still be used in an reduction block 

.Notes
. `parsergen` deals only context-free grammars. Therefore exactly one non-terminal is allowed to the left of ::= per production.
. A reduced non-terminal operand combines with zero or more terminal/ non-terminal neighbors, reduces again into 'upper' non-terminal, ... and eventually reduces into <@>, the root non-terminal _aka_ the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar#Formal_definitions[start symbol]. Thus the whole input string parsed is deemed _accepted_.  
. When there is no production rule at all, the grammar defined a language only accepting empty string, demonstrated by link:../example/MinLang/[MinLang]

CAUTION: ðŸ’£ `parsergen` has to know the start symbol before calculation. If there is a production like `<@> ::= ...`, then *<@>* is the start symbol. Otherwise, the left side of ::= in the _first parsed production_, say *<All>*, becomes the _defacto_ start symbol, and an extra production `<@> ::= <All>` is added implicitly.

Enable *error recovery* mechanism of the base parser class by telling `I_ParserPolicy` error token id is `TID_LEX_Error`, which will be defined in **Parser**_IdDef.h_

bool C_ParserPolicy::changeToken(T_LexID &token, C_LexPtr &attr) const

A change to break down a scanned token input and take its first char as new input to resume parsing.

=== 5. # Directives
Seriously, these are not preprocessor directives but processed in the same pass as other type of lines. They just happen to use same old syntaxes:
[%autowidth,cols="2*<.^a"]
|===
^.^h| Directive ^.^h| Meaning
| [source%nowrap,c++]
#include "Foo" | Replace this line with lines within file _"Foo"_
| [source%nowrap,c++]
#ifdef _Bar_ | If option `%Bar` is defined, include subsequent lines until whichever the **paired** `#else` or `#endif` is encountered first. Otherwise, include lines between `#else` and `#endif` if `#else` is present.
| [source%nowrap,c++]
#ifndef _Bar_ | If option `%Bar` is undefined, include subsequent lines until whichever the **paired** `#else` or `#endif` is encountered first. Otherwise, include lines between `#else` and `#endif` if `#else` is present.
| [source%nowrap,c++]
#else | 
| [source%nowrap,c++]
#endif | 
|===

IMPORTANT: Pairing rules of `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#else`, `#endif` comply with https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/conditional)[C++ preprocessor counterparts]

TIP: No `#if _(expr)_` and `#elif _(expr)_` because relevant scenarios are yet to be seen and the implementing effort is estimated high.

=== 6. Parser class naming
.Syntax
*class* (`<namespace>` ::)* `<class_name>`

.Example
*class* `Main::C_BNFParser`

.Notes
. At most one such line is allowed. 
. When absent, the parser class has the default name `::C_Parser`
. This will become a problem only when an application uses multiple `parsergen`-generated parsers.   
. Use of namespace(s) is encouraged when the generated parser is part of a library.
